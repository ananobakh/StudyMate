**Project Name**
StudyMate

**Brief Description**
StudyMate is a personalized learning tool that lets users create, modify and study flashcards, as well as test themselves using multiple types of quizzes. It adapts to each user's progress by dynamically targeting weak areas with its "Common Mistakes Quiz" feature, offers diverse quiz modes (timed, stopwatch, multiple choice test, open ended questions), and motivates learners with a competitive leaderboard. The leaderboard scoring logic is carefully designed to balance speed and accuracy; correct answers earn extra points while using a timer, mistakes in "Common Mistakes Quiz" cause penalties and failing to finishing within time limit resets the score to 0 and deducts 10 more points. Additionally, writing Math quiz with open-ended questions award more points to encourage and ensure better understanding. The app also provides detailed statistics to track user progress. This system makes the process more competitive and fosters precision and continous engagement, making self-study effective, more interactive and rewarding.
